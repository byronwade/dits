# Standout Features: Radical Ideas to Differentiate Dits

## The Big Bet: "Dits is Creative AI, Not Just Version Control"

Transform Dits from a technical tool into an **intelligent creative partner** that fundamentally changes how creative work gets done.

---

## 🌟 Category-Defining Features

### 1. **"Creative Intent Versioning"** - The Game-Changer

**Problem:** Version control treats all changes as "file modified." Creative professionals need to know *what* changed artistically.

**Solution:** Dits understands and versions creative intent.

**Features:**
- **Video Edits:** "Color grade adjusted in scene 3" vs "video.mp4 modified"
- **Project Changes:** "Added 2 seconds to dialogue scene" vs "project.prproj changed"
- **Asset Usage:** "This shot now used in 3 places" vs "file moved"
- **Semantic Conflicts:** "Two editors adjusted timing - merge automatically" vs "merge conflict"

**Marketing:** *"Dits is the only VCS that speaks your creative language. It versions artistic decisions, not just bytes."*

---

### 2. **"AI Creative Director"** - The Intelligence Layer

**Problem:** Creative teams waste hours searching, comparing, and rediscovering creative decisions.

**Solution:** Built-in AI that acts as your creative assistant.

**Features:**
- **Visual Search:** "Find shots where the actor looks confident and lighting is warm"
- **Creative Memory:** "Show me what we tried for this character's reaction shot"
- **Similarity Matching:** "Find similar compositions to this frame"
- **Automated QC:** "Flag shots with focus issues or audio sync problems"
- **Style Analysis:** "This project uses warm lighting 70% of the time"

**Marketing:** *"Dits remembers your creative vision and helps you execute it perfectly."*

---

### 3. **"Universal Creative Format"** - Tool Freedom

**Problem:** Creative work gets locked into specific applications (Premiere, Resolve, FCPX).

**Solution:** Dits becomes the universal creative project format.

**Features:**
- **Format Translation:** Convert timelines between any NLE instantly
- **Cross-Tool References:** Assets work across applications seamlessly
- **Workflow Preservation:** Edit decisions survive tool switches
- **Automated Exports:** "Generate social media versions" (adapts automatically)

**Marketing:** *"Your creative work is free from tool lock-in. Edit anywhere, finish everywhere."*

---

### 4. **"Live Creative Collaboration"** - Real-Time Awareness

**Problem:** Creative collaboration is asynchronous and painful.

**Solution:** Live, context-aware creative collaboration.

**Features:**
- **Intent Broadcasting:** "Sarah is color-correcting the sunset scene"
- **Live Previews:** See low-res changes before they sync
- **Creative Locks:** "Working on audio mix for 10 minutes"
- **Session Playback:** "Watch how we developed this scene together"

**Marketing:** *"See your team's creative process unfold in real-time. No more surprises at review."*

---

### 5. **"Predictive Asset Management"** - Proactive Intelligence

**Problem:** Creative teams run out of space, lose assets, or can't find what they need.

**Solution:** AI that anticipates and manages creative assets.

**Features:**
- **Usage Prediction:** "Based on your workflow, you'll need these assets next"
- **Smart Archiving:** "This footage hasn't been touched in 6 months - archive?"
- **Storage Optimization:** "Transcode this 4K to 1080p for review?"
- **Creative Context:** "You might need these similar shots for continuity"

**Marketing:** *"Dits manages your creative assets so you can focus on creating, not administrating."*
